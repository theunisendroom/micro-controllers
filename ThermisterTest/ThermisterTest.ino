//Thermistor related:

/* Here we have a few constants that make editing the code easier. I will go
   through them one by one.

   A reading from the ADC might give one value at one sample and then a little
   different the next time around. To eliminate noisy readings, we can sample
   the ADC pin a few times and then average the samples to get something more 
   solid. This constant is utilized in the readThermistor function.

/*
This function reads the analog pin as shown below. Converts voltage signal
to a digital representation with analog to digital conversion. However, this is
done multiple times so that we can average it to eliminate measurement errors.
This averaged number is then used to calculate the resistance of the thermistor. 
After this, the resistance is used to calculate the temperature of the 
thermistor. Finally, the temperature is converted to celsius. Please refer to
the allaboutcircuits.com article for the specifics and general theory of this
process.

Quick Schematic in case you are too lazy to look at the site :P
